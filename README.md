## FX Rate Monitoring Dashboard

Power BI dashboard for monitoring USD foreign exchange trends across six major currency pairs (AUD, CNY, BRL, EUR, GBP, CAD). The dashboard provides trend and variance analysis using adjustable rolling averages (SMA) and ±σ bands, along with MTD/QTD/YTD performance metrics for each currency pair.

Developed to support executive treasury decisions, it balances analytical depth with readability, using a consistent multi-panel layout and fixed scaling to maintain interpretive clarity under strict design constraints.
